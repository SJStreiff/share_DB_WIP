    Not feasible i think. Connection works fine, but the output from their database is not amazingly helpful.

i  Extend beyond Philippines --> Indonesia, Papua, New Caledonia, ....country by country works quite well here...
WIP: indonesia is being done. s.n.

* Georeference data for species with nothing so far... Local databases, protologues/treatments


## Split cleaning step from merging step

i.e. first clean data within one step, then second one to compare and merge with main database
