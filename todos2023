# TODO for beginning 2023


* HUH botanists query possible? that would be cool
    https://realpython.com/api-integration-in-python/?

  
* Extend beyond Philippines --> Indonesia, Papua, New Caledonia, ....country by country works quite well here...
* Georeference data for species with nothing so far... Local databases, protologues/treatments


## Split cleaning step from merging step 

i.e. first clean data within one step, then second one to compare and merge with main database
