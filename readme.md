# PIPELINE for standardising data



The code can be called as

'''
python record_cleaner.py -h
'''



## TODO

* Write readme
* add overwrite protection in case script is called multiple times, at least for time intensive steps (removed for debugging!!) --> done as mode='x' for example within pd.to_csv()
