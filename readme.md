# Record cleaner

## The/A PIPELINE for standardising occurrence records

![There would be a funny picture here normally](TMP_titleimage.png "")

The code can be called as

'''
python record_cleaner.py -h
'''



## TODO

* Write readme
* add overwrite protection in case script is called multiple times, at least for time intensive steps (removed for debugging!!) --> done as mode='x' for example within pd.to_csv()
